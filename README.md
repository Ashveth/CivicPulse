🌍 CivicPulse

CivicPulse is a community-driven civic engagement platform that helps people report, discuss, and track local problems in cities, campuses, and neighborhoods using modern web technology and AI.

Turning everyday civic issues into visible, actionable insights.

🚀 Inspiration

Most tech products focus on global-scale problems, while local issues — broken infrastructure, safety concerns, campus problems, and community needs — remain ignored.

CivicPulse was built to give local communities a real voice, making civic participation simple, transparent, and impactful.
